              Renewable Exchange was founded in 2016 by Robert Ogden with a goal
              of improving the power trading market. It is now the largest
              online platform connecting renewable energy generators and buyers
              to ensure a transparent and data-driven power trading process in
              the UK.

              The Renewable Exchange PPA marketplace enables generators of any
              size to fully optimise and transact the sale of their electricity.
              It is now trusted by more than 1800 independent generators in the
              UK representing over 5.6 GW of installed capacity.

              The huge success of the platform is seen through client
              endorsements and recommendations. “Nearly every other new customer
              registering on our platform comes through a referral. This speaks
              volumes about the value we deliver”, says Oliver Hunt, Head of
              Renewables.
